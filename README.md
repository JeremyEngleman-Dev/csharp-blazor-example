## Intro
I created this project to learn the basics of Blazor, components, and linking it to a backend API.

## Features
- View/Add/Delete employees listed in a backend API (https://github.com/JeremyEngleman-Dev/csharp-api-example)
- Employee add and delete requires admin role
- View the employee changes in real time using SignalR

## Test user data
```
Admin - Read/Create/Edit/Delete
email: jsmith@company.com
password: adminSecret
```
```
User - Read Only
email: rsmith@company.com
password: userSecret
```
